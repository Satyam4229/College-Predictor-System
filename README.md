# College Predictor System
This the project of the Data Science where we predict the collegese for the student after their marks by the model. The model is based on the report of the various NIT and IIT colleges and their admission procedure.

First, we analyze the data of the different colleges and their stat for admission in various programs, then the model suggest the student top colleges as per their features to get admission in it.

## Process to make the model :-
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Pre - Processing
3. Data Visualization 
4. Training and Testing Dataset
5. Creating Model
6. Optimizing the model
7. check accuracy
